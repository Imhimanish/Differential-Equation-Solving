The Euler method also called forward euler method is a first order numerical
procedure for solving ordinary differential equation.(ODEs) with a given
initial values.


The formula for the Euler’s method is :-
y(x+h) = y(x) + h*f(x+y)


Here ‘h’ stands for the slope of the function at initial points.
Using the euler’s method we can get an approximate graph for a given function.
Using the Euler’s method plot graph of the function f(x) = e-x
and compare it with its original graph.
